## About me
My name is Salvador Salazar III. I have a bachelor's degree in Baking & Pastry Arts, but I'm looking to change career paths in order to increase my earnings potential and to give myself the option of working from home in the event of another emergency situation. I chose FinTech because I enjoy using and learning about technology, both personally and profesionally, and I have become increasingly interested in the stock market and managing my personal finances.
